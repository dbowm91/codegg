# CodeGG Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for interim planning. It links active documents and blockers without duplicating their detailed requirements.

Canonical direction remains in:

- `plans/000-long-term-specification.md`
- `plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md`
- `plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md`
- `plans/003-planning-process.md`

## Status vocabulary

- **proposed** — roadmap or plan exists but is not approved for execution.
- **ready** — dependencies and interfaces are satisfied; plan may be handed off.
- **active** — implementation or closure work is in progress.
- **blocked** — a named dependency or evidence requirement prevents progress.
- **closing** — implementation landed and closure evidence is being gathered.
- **closed** — closure record accepted.
- **conditionally closed** — substantial work landed, but a named correctness finding prevents strict closure.
- **superseded** — replaced by another document.
- **archived** — no longer active and retained for traceability.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies or blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Domain identity and compatibility | closed | `plans/subsystems/domain-identity-roadmap.md` | Milestone 4 closed | — |
| Runtime assets and harness interoperability | closed | `plans/subsystems/runtime-assets-roadmap.md` | Milestone 4 closed | — |
| Provider connections and Eggpool | closed | `plans/subsystems/provider-connections-roadmap.md` | Milestone 5 closed | — |
| Project catalog and lazy discovery | closed | `plans/subsystems/project-catalog-roadmap.md` | Milestone 4 closed | — |
| Multi-project TUI and sessions | closed | `plans/subsystems/tui-project-sessions-roadmap.md` | Milestones 001–004 closed | — |
| Frontend-neutral session projections | active | `plans/subsystems/session-projections-roadmap.md` | Milestone 008 — final transport lifecycle and replay evidence polish | Ready; M007 remains conditionally closed on joined WebSocket task teardown, complete adapter-level failure evidence, exact replay sequence continuity, and final closure reconciliation |

## Dependency-ready implementation plans

| Subsystem | Milestone | Class | Plan | Baseline | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend-neutral session projections | 008 — final transport lifecycle and replay evidence polish | correctness polish / task lifecycle / adapter verification / closure reconciliation | `plans/implementation/session-projections/008-final-transport-lifecycle-and-replay-evidence-polish.md` | `8b547a3` | ready |

## Active closure work

| Subsystem | Milestone | Closure record | Status | Open findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend-neutral session projections | 007 — corrective transport lifecycle and evidence closure | `plans/closure/session-projections/007-status.md` | conditionally closed | `/core` and `/tui` sibling tasks are aborted but not awaited; staged adapter failure matrix is incomplete; reconnect tests do not prove full envelope sequence continuity and no duplication |

## Blocked work

| Work item | Blocker | Required resolution | Owner document |
|---|---|---|---|
| Return Session Projections roadmap to strict closed status | M008 final lifecycle/evidence findings | Implement joined `/core` and `/tui` connection-task teardown, complete staged adapter failures, prove exact replay-to-live envelope sequences without gaps/duplicates, and accept an M008 closure record | `plans/implementation/session-projections/008-final-transport-lifecycle-and-replay-evidence-polish.md` |

## Deferred unregistered product work

These are not dependency-ready correctness plans and remain outside the active handoff:

- cross-tab artifact hand-off UX;
- numeric acknowledgement/resync hot-key UX;
- plugin-specific `ProjectionEvent::PluginUi` semantics;
- final removal of legacy remote variants after the compatibility window;
- final team roles, presence, and chat.

## Recently closed work

## Registry maintenance rules

1. Add a subsystem roadmap when it becomes active, not merely because it is a possible future track.
2. Register an implementation plan as dependency-ready only after dependency and handoff review.
3. Move a plan from ready to active when implementation begins.
4. Move it to closing when production work lands and closure review starts.
5. Mark it closed only when the linked closure record says closed.
6. Use conditionally closed when a post-closure correctness finding invalidates a strict claim.
7. Record blockers precisely and link the document that owns their resolution.
8. Remove closed rows from active sections after recording them under recently closed work.
9. Periodically archive old closed interim documents while preserving links.
10. Do not copy detailed milestone requirements into this registry.
11. When one milestone closes, create/register only the next dependency-ready handoff.
